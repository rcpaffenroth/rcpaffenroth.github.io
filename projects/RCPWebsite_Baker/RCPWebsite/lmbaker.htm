The goal of this project is to apply compressive sensing techniques to measurements provided by Nanocomp Inc., a company producing carbon nanotube products. This project is concerned with the thickness and uniformity of carbon nanotube sheets. Taking advantage of the sparsity of this data when transformed from the spatial to the Fourier domain, research will determine if this property can be used to generate accurate higher-resolution data on these sheets. This will ultimately allow Nanocomp to measure the effects of changes in their production process on sheet quality.
