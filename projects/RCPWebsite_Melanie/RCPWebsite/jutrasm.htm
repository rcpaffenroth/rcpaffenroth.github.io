<p><img src="jutrasMatrix.jpg" height="175" width="400"align="right">The goal of this research is to utilize Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) for the purpose of anomaly detection in DNS network packet data. Computer network traffic meets all of the criteria for Big Data. When dealing with high dimensional data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common technique used for dimensionality reduction. Because traditional PCA is known to be sensitive to outliers, a robust version of PCA called RPCA is used. Through the use of a tuning parameter, RPCA can be used to separate the original data into two parts: regular network data and anomalous network data. This data science technique allows for tuning a model utilizing a very small amount of training data.  The method described here is useful for cybersecurity because these types of problems are largely unsupervised and often involve high dimensional network data with sparse anomalies.
