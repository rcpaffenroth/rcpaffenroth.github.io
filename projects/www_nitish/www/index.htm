Financial markets are high-dimensional, complex, and constantly changing.  Under stressed market conditions the 
changes are amplified.  Financial market can be represented by an underlying manifold in low-dimension that captures 
the inherent characteristics of the high-dimensional data.  Using Russell 3000 constituents and both geodesic and 
informational geometric schemes, we determine the temporal dimensionality of US market.  Further, we use rate of 
change in US market dimensionality over 30 years to detect early warning system. Additionally, using intra-day prices 
we zoom into temporal dimensionality around large market movements to detect early perturbation in financial system. 
We not only study the benefit of using non-linear techniques such as Isomap, over linear technique such as PCA or 
Multidimensional Scaling but also compare and contrast the use of geodesic distance and informational geometric distances.
